    <legend><h1>Semantics in HTML</h1></legend>
    <p>üëâ In HTML, for example, the <small>&lth1&gt </small> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."</p>
    <p>‚Ä£ <mark>Here is a top level heading</mark></p>
    <p>üëâ By default, most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an <hi> with a large font size to make it look like a heading (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted). On the other hand, you could make any element look like a top level heading.</p>
    <p>‚Ä£ <mark>Consider the following</mark></p>
    <p>‚á® This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits as described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job.</p>
    <p>‚á® HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling. Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.</p>

    <legend><h3>Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:</h3></legend>
   
<ul>
    <li>Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO">SEO</a>)</li>
    <li>Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page</li>
    <li>Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes</li>
    <li>Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated</li>
    <li>Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming</li>

<fieldset><legend><h1>SEO</h1></legend>
    <p>‚≠ê <mark>(Search Engine Optimization)</mark> is the process of making a website more visible in search results, also termed improving search rankings. </p>
    <p>‚≠ê Search engines <b>crawl</b> the web, following links from page to page, and index the content found. When you search, the search engine displays the indexed content. Crawlers follow rules. If you follow those rules closely when doing SEO for a website, you give the site the best chances of showing up among the first results, increasing traffic and possibly revenue (for ecommerce and ads).</p>
    <p>‚≠ê Search engines give some guidelines for SEO, but big search engines keep result ranking as a trade secret. SEO combines official search engine guidelines, empirical knowledge, and theoretical knowledge from science papers or patent</p>
